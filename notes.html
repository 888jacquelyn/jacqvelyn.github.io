    <p class="div-1">okay well, now it's 2024. this shit is kinda getting ridiculous. but for whatever reason, i am content despite the absurdity and failures. im glad to know the people that i've managed to maintain at least some relationship with have stayed along for everything. 2023 was without a doubt my worst year for one reason or another. or at least it sure seems like it. i won't get into specifics and i won't pretend a lot of it wasn't my own fault. this year will be difficult and i'll face whatever trials lie ahead regardless of my confidence. and that is to say, ill face it whether i actually want to or not, on account of life never offering much of an option. whatever level of bullshit profoundity this is possibly triggering to myself, or anyone else reading... dont let it fool you, this was always nonsense to begin with. good luck.</p>

    <p class="div-1">i apologize, i never know what to put here. i wrote a little journal entry once before deleting it. i would like to write something interesting. or at least structured in some form. but my attention span is that of a goldfish and i don't have much in my mind to allow to create something in the first place. i have a hard time spending much time on one thing now, i guess. in the past, updating the site quickly becomes unsatisfying,unimportant, and progress slows to nothing. i would hate to leave behind nothing but my social media accounts, lost to time, dependant on the service/platform it lives on to exist in the future. i feel as though there is little in my head, i dont have much to share, i dont really seek new forms of content. most of the content i consume is pretty bottom of the barrel and i frequently rewatch a series multiple times. if you knew how many times ive seen each episode of family guy you would have me tracked down and killed.
    i am sorry.</p>

    <p class="div-1">no more explaination of lofty goals to soon be neglected. a bit of humility employed in acts of goodwill demonstrated to no one in particular, without concern for recognition or acknowledgement. an effort to regularly express gratitude for all things promoting happiness, health, and wisdom within Me and the life that surrounds me. i love you. jacquelyn loves you...</p>

    <p class="div-1">somehow i had started to pull myself out of the hole i dug myself. at least a bit. i started working again and i have been happy with my progress, though there are still serious issues ive neglected to work on. it wasnt very long ago that i felt like i simply couldn't do anything, and that there was no point in putting forth effort. despite being able to more readily recognize triggers and acknowledge the progress i have made over this year, i feel sick. i do not quite understand what is wrong with me. i don't feel human, i have no confidence in my actions or words. i regularly fail to express my thoughts properly. i make mistakes so often, but im aware of them. if one didnt know i was aware that i made a mistake or said/did something weird, they may very well come to the conclusion that im a goddamned simpleton. ive began to second guess everything, all my actions, my relationships, whether or not i can trust someone, whether or not i can trust myself. maybe there is just genuinely something wrong with me... i mean, there definitely is... and that's fine... i know im not normal and my mind doesn't work exactly as it should. but ive isolated myself socially/emotionally to a detrimental degree. i want people to be happy with me and my presense, but im too focused on worrying about all the reasons someone wouldn't want to interact with me that i am rarely emotionally availible and attentive to anyone, regardless of my connection to them or how much i want to build upon that connection. its easier for me to withdraw completely. <strong> who am i to impose my mind upon those i love and admire? </strong> </p>

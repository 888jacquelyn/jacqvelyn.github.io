    <p>i apologize, i never know what to put here. i wrote a little journal entry once before deleting it. i would like to write something interesting. or at least structured in some form. but my attention span is that of a goldfish and i don't have much in my mind to allow to create something in the first place. i have a hard time spending much time on one thing now, i guess. in the past, updating the site quickly becomes unsatisfying,unimportant, and progress slows to nothing. i would hate to leave behind nothing but my social media accounts, lost to time, dependant on the service/platform it lives on to exist in the future. i feel as though there is little in my head, i dont have much to share, i dont really seek new forms of content. most of the content i consume is pretty bottom of the barrel and i frequently rewatch a series multiple times. if you knew how many times ive seen each episode of family guy you would have me tracked down and killed.
    i am sorry.</p>
